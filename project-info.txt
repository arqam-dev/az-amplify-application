--------------------------- Steps ---------------------------

1. Created git repo + cloned it.
2. ng new az-amplify-application
3. updated polyfills.ts
4. amplify configure - Will create a IAM user having accessKey and secretKey.
5. amplify init - will create amplify app (Local + AWS Console) using above IAM user. backend folder with cloud formation.
6. amplify add api -  Create schema.graphql file. connect AppSync to it. (Schema will be added locally whoich will create the table when we push it)
6. amplify push - will create api.service.ts file, AppSync api on the console. Create table in dynamo db on console.
    --> Mistakenly deleted the tables from console. So, done the following steps again to go to the previous state.
        -> amplify delete
        -> amplify init
        -> amplify add api
        -> amplify push
7. Replaced the ToDo schema with Restaurant schema and done amplify push again. 
    -> (it should be replaced after adding the api so that no need to push it again) 
    -> Command: amplify push --allow-destructive-graphql-schema-updates // used this flag as needed to del the ToDo table.

8. Updated:
    -> src/main.ts with the given code on https://docs.amplify.aws/ in "Connect frontend to API" section.
    -> tsconfig.app.json
    -> renamed the aws-exports.js to ".ts"
